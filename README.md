# TinyTimer

This is a study project called TinyTimer.
I'm interested in how much time I spend on different apps everyday.
In fact I found a useful app named ManicTime which exactly meets my demand, but I still want to have fun coding.

## Console version

- v0.01 a very simple trial
- v0.02 incompleted refactoring of v0.01, I try to use 2 classes to represent different apps and different windows of one app
- v0.03 add some basic functions
- v0.04 add save file function

## Learn GUI programming...

SFMLTimer for having fun with SFML

- v0.01 display timer
- v0.02 new timer, low CPU usage, try multithread after reading <Cpp Concurrency in Action>
- v0.10 more friendly UI, implemented two button for switch and reset

## Others:

Based on SFML, tested on windows 10 with MSVC
