This is a study project called TinyTimer.
I'm interested in how much time I spend on different apps everyday.
In fact I found a useful app named ManicTime which exactly meets my demand, but I still want to have fun coding.

v0.01 a very simple trial
v0.02 incompleted refactoring of v0.01, I try to use 2 classes to represent different apps and different windows of one app
v0.03 add some basic functions
v0.04 add save file function
